# Clash of Clans Manager
This extracurricular project was developed for my personal use after I learned about technologies such as Hibernate, Spring Boot, and MVC models. The main objective of this system is to store relevant data regarding the users that form a specific clan in this game.

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of these technologies and to test the knowledge I obtained about organizing and managing a project of this nature. Through this development, I gained practical skills in implementing Hibernate for data persistence management, utilizing Spring Boot to create robust and scalable applications, and applying MVC models to structure code efficiently and maintainably.

Furthermore, the project provided me with valuable experience in integrating and coordinating different technological components, solving complex problems, and continuously improving the system based on testing and feedback. This work not only strengthened my technical capabilities but also enhanced my skills in project planning and execution, collaboration, and adaptability in a dynamic environment.
